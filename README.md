# techtalkbots
These are the bots created for the SRE Tech Talk, October 2022

1) Use the NodeJS Websockets Hookbuster application to bypass the need for a Webhook.
2) Create a bot at developer.webex.com
3) Export the bot's token as an evnironment variable (the token will also be needed for Hookbuster).
4) Clone the repo
5) Install packages --> pip install flask, webexteamssdk, python-aiml
6) python app.py (runs simplebot)
7) python bot.py (runs a modified aiml bot)
